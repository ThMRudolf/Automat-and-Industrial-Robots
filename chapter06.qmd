## 1. Introduction

The kinematic analysis of a robot is performed using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. This method is essential for describing the transformations of the joints and links of an industrial robot. In this material, we discuss how the coordinate system is defined for each joint and how transformations are applied to calculate the position of the TCP (Tool Center Point).

## 3. Forward and Inverse Kinematics

Forward kinematics describes how the position and orientation of the TCP depend on the joint variables (angles and displacements). On the other hand, inverse kinematics involves calculating the joint angles from a desired TCP position.

## 4. Homogeneous Transformations

Homogeneous transformations are used to describe the position and orientation of links in three-dimensional space using 4x4 matrices. Below are examples of transformations.

## 5. Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters

The Denavit-Hartenberg parameterization uses four parameters to describe each link of the robot:  
1. \( \theta_n \) - Angle between the axes \( x_{n-1} \) and \( x_n \), rotated about \( z_{n-1} \).
2. \( d_n \) - Distance between the origins \( O_n \) and \( O_{n-1} \) along the \( z_{n-1} \) axis.
3. \( a_n \) - Perpendicular distance between the \( z_{n-1} \) and \( z_n \) axes.
4. \( \alpha_n \) - Angle between the \( z_{n-1} \) and \( z_n \) axes, rotated about \( x_n \).

## 6. Mathematical Model of a 6-DOF Robot

The model of a 6-degree-of-freedom robot is described by the transformations of each link, applying the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters to obtain the TCP position in the global coordinate system.

## 7. Inverse Kinematics Ambiguities

When solving inverse kinematics, multiple solutions for the joint angles can arise. These ambiguities occur because the positions of the higher axes depend on the positions of the lower axes. Approximation procedures exist for conventional robots.

## 9. Conclusion

Kinematic analysis is essential for robot control and simulation. Using the Denavit-Hartenberg model, the position and orientation of the TCP can be efficiently calculated. Additionally, inverse kinematics is crucial for determining the joint angles in practical applications.

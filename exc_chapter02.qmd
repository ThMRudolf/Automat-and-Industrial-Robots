## Exercises

### Exercise 11: Boyle’s Law Calculation
- **Sequence**: A tank with a volume of 0.5 $m^3$ is filled to a gauge pressure of 7 bar at 40°C. The temperature then drops to 20°C. Find the resulting pressure.
- **Steps**:
    - Use Boyle's Law to calculate the new pressure at the given temperature.
- **Solution**:
    - Perform the calculation using the appropriate gas laws.

---

### Exercise 12: Charles’ Law Calculation
- **Sequence**: Using Charles’ Law, calculate how the volume of a gas changes when the temperature changes, assuming constant pressure.
- **Solution**:
    - Apply the equation: $V_1 / T_1 = V_2 / T_2$ and solve for the unknown volume.

---

### Exercise 13: Using Boyle’s and Charles’ Laws Together
- **Sequence**: Calculate the changes in volume and pressure when a gas undergoes a temperature and pressure change, using Boyle’s and Charles’ laws.
- **Steps**:
    - Use the appropriate equations and assumptions for a combined process (adiabatic or isothermal).
- **Solution**:
    - Solve the equations using the given values for pressure, volume, and temperature.

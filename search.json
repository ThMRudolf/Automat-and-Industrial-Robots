The controller calulates an input signal for the actuator. The output of the actuator starts manipulating the system. Since the controler does not receives any feedback on how the systems reacts on the command the results might be different from the desired behaviour. Examples for the application of open loop control are: A tennis player who hits the ball, if you turn on a light in you room or a DC motor without sensors.\n\n\n\nfig. 1.1: general structure of a open loop control\n\n\nTo improve the resulting behaviour and be able to correct possible differences between the commad value and the resulting value, one can implement sensors that observe the resulting behaviour of the systems or process. This sensors return the current behaviour to the controller and the controller can correct the input signal to the actuator. The following figure shows the general structure of a close loop control.\n\n\n\nfig. 1.2: general structure of a close loop control",

    "text": "The word ‘Pneumatics’ is derived from the Greek ‘neuma’ (air or breath). Originally, the term pneumatics designated the science of the movement and properties of air. This is the branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of compressed air, its generation, transmission and control.\nThe design of devices that used air energy dates back to the 18th century (with the pneumatic rifle). “Modern” devices: pneumatic rock drill, pneumatic brakes. “Modern” pneumatics was born in the 1950s, when techniques and forms of air energy control were introduced in industrial processes.\n\n\n\nIt is abundant. It is available in unlimited quantities.\nIt is transportable. It is easily transported through pipes.\nIt is storable. It is easily stored in tanks where pressure is maintained.\nIt is transmitted relatively quickly.\nIt is clean. In case of stagnation, it does not produce dirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison with other technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollution\n\nApart from energy loss, no disadvantages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental influences\nExplosion hazard in certain environments; relatively sensitive to temperature.\nSensitive to temperature fluctuations; Fire hazard in case of leaks.\nDoes not cause explosions; Insensitive to temperatures.\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nDifficult and only in small quantities using batteries\nWithin certain limits, using gases\nEasy\n\n\n\nEnergy transport\nUnlimited, but with energy loss\nUp to 100 m with flow velocity of v = 2-6 m/s, signal velocity up to 1000 m/s.\nUp to 1000 m with flow velocity v = 20-40 m/s, signal velocity 20-40 m/s.\n\n\n\nWorking speed\n\nv = 0.5 m/s\nv = 1.5 m/s\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of pneumatic energy over hydraulic energy\nAir density is significantly smaller than that of oil (used in hydraulics). Therefore, the inertia effect is smaller. Air can be discharged into the atmosphere after a task. Pneumatic systems are more economical. Pneumatic systems are less toxic and cleaner. Pneumatic systems are lighter, easier to transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\nDisadvantage\n\n\n\n\n\nAir is available in unlimited quantities\nAir (compressed) can be easily transported in pipes\nIt does not require any treatment for its elimination. It is simply thrown into the atmosphere.\nCompressed air is insensitive to fluctuations in temperature\nCompressed air is clean, therefore used in the food and pharmaceutical industries\nCompressed air allows operation at high speeds\nThe tools and operating elements are safe, when they are overloaded they simply stop working.\n\n\nIt is relatively expensive to transport. The high costs are offset by the cheapness of the elements and the simple and more compact nature of its equipment.\nCompressed air requires conditioning to remove dust and moisture.\nIt is difficult to achieve uniform piston speeds with compressed air.\nNoise levels in the operation of pneumatic systems are high due to air leakage.\nLubricated air (with oil) can escape into the atmosphere and cause pollution.\nDue to its low conductivity, it cannot dissipate heat as easily as oil would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition: Types of gases that make up the air under consideration. Example: dry air at sea level is composed mainly of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (20.99%). Shape and volume: They have no defined shape or volume. They acquire the shape and volume of the tank that contains them. Cost (Flow): It is the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of the duct per unit of time.\nThe relative humidity is the amount of water vapor contained in volume of air. It depends on the air temperature and pressure. When the air is saturated, it means that the relative humidity is at 100%.\nConsider the behavior of air with water under defined circumstances: temperature 20°C and a relative humidity of 50%. This means that it contains 8.7g of water which is the half of the maximum 17.4g.\nWhen the compressor compresses the 4 \\(𝑚^3\\). to form 1 \\(𝑚^3\\), the \\(4×8.7=34.8 g\\) of water cannot hold in it. The \\(𝑚^3\\) can hold at most 17.4 g of water. The other \\(2×8.7=17.4g\\) fall as drops.\n\n\n\nfig. 2.1 effect on air with relative humidity when compressed\n\n\nConclusion: When air is compressed, water \\(H_2O\\) liquefies from gaseous state to liquid state. The water vapor in the air is also compressed and the result is similar to squeezing a sponge. The compressed air reaches a saturation of 100% relative humidity inside the tank. The separated water can be drained via a drainage system.\nThe flow is defined as the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of duct per unit of time. Generally the letter \\(Q\\) is used. \\(Q = \\frac{V}{t}=\\frac{A s}{t}\\) wit \\(s\\) as displacement, \\(A\\) as areaof the cross section and \\(t\\) as time. Considering that \\(\\frac{s}{t}\\)displacement per time unit is velocity, one can rewrite \\(Q=Av\\). The standard units of the variables are as follows:\n\n\\([Q] = [ \\frac{m^3}{s}]\\)\n\\([A] = [m^2]\\)\n\\([v] = [\\frac{m}{s}]\\)\n\n\n\nFig. 2.2 graphical description of flow $Q$\n\n\n\nGas pressure and gas laws: The relation between force \\(F\\) and pressure \\(p\\) is related by its contact cross section area A: \\(F=pA\\).

    "text": "The word ‘Pneumatics’ is derived from the Greek ‘neuma’ (air or breath). Originally, the term pneumatics designated the science of the movement and properties of air. This is the branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of compressed air, its generation, transmission and control.\nThe design of devices that used air energy dates back to the 18th century (with the pneumatic rifle). “Modern” devices: pneumatic rock drill, pneumatic brakes. “Modern” pneumatics was born in the 1950s, when techniques and forms of air energy control were introduced in industrial processes.\n\n\n\nIt is abundant. It is available in unlimited quantities.\nIt is transportable. It is easily transported through pipes.\nIt is storable. It is easily stored in tanks where pressure is maintained.\nIt is transmitted relatively quickly.\nIt is clean. In case of stagnation, it does not produce dirt.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison with other technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollution\n\nApart from energy loss, no disadvantages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental influences\nExplosion hazard in certain environments; relatively sensitive to temperature.\nSensitive to temperature fluctuations; Fire hazard in case of leaks.\nDoes not cause explosions; Insensitive to temperatures.\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nDifficult and only in small quantities using batteries\nWithin certain limits, using gases\nEasy\n\n\n\nEnergy transport\nUnlimited, but with energy loss\nUp to 100 m with flow velocity of v = 2-6 m/s, signal velocity up to 1000 m/s.\nUp to 1000 m with flow velocity v = 20-40 m/s, signal velocity 20-40 m/s.\n\n\n\nWorking speed\n\nv = 0.5 m/s\nv = 1.5 m/s\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of pneumatic energy over hydraulic energy\nAir density is significantly smaller than that of oil (used in hydraulics). Therefore, the inertia effect is smaller. Air can be discharged into the atmosphere after a task. Pneumatic systems are more economical. Pneumatic systems are less toxic and cleaner. Pneumatic systems are lighter, easier to transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\nDisadvantage\n\n\n\n\n\nAir is available in unlimited quantities\nAir (compressed) can be easily transported in pipes\nIt does not require any treatment for its elimination. It is simply thrown into the atmosphere.\nCompressed air is insensitive to fluctuations in temperature\nCompressed air is clean, therefore used in the food and pharmaceutical industries\nCompressed air allows operation at high speeds\nThe tools and operating elements are safe, when they are overloaded they simply stop working.\n\n\nIt is relatively expensive to transport. The high costs are offset by the cheapness of the elements and the simple and more compact nature of its equipment.\nCompressed air requires conditioning to remove dust and moisture.\nIt is difficult to achieve uniform piston speeds with compressed air.\nNoise levels in the operation of pneumatic systems are high due to air leakage.\nLubricated air (with oil) can escape into the atmosphere and cause pollution.\nDue to its low conductivity, it cannot dissipate heat as easily as oil would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition: Types of gases that make up the air under consideration. Example: dry air at sea level is composed mainly of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (20.99%). Shape and volume: They have no defined shape or volume. They acquire the shape and volume of the tank that contains them. Cost (Flow): It is the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of the duct per unit of time.\nThe relative humidity is the amount of water vapor contained in volume of air. It depends on the air temperature and pressure. When the air is saturated, it means that the relative humidity is at 100%.\nConsider the behavior of air with water under defined circumstances: temperature 20°C and a relative humidity of 50%. This means that it contains 8.7g of water which is the half of the maximum 17.4g.\nWhen the compressor compresses the 4 \\(𝑚^3\\). to form 1 \\(𝑚^3\\), the \\(4×8.7=34.8 g\\) of water cannot hold in it. The \\(𝑚^3\\) can hold at most 17.4 g of water. The other \\(2×8.7=17.4g\\) fall as drops.\n\n\n\nfig. 2.1 effect on air with relative humidity when compressed\n\n\nConclusion: When air is compressed, water \\(H_2O\\) liquefies from gaseous state to liquid state. The water vapor in the air is also compressed and the result is similar to squeezing a sponge. The compressed air reaches a saturation of 100% relative humidity inside the tank. The separated water can be drained via a drainage system.\nThe flow is defined as the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of duct per unit of time. Generally the letter \\(Q\\) is used. \\(Q = \\frac{V}{t}=\\frac{A s}{t}\\) wit \\(s\\) as displacement, \\(A\\) as areaof the cross section and \\(t\\) as time. Considering that \\(\\frac{s}{t}\\)displacement per time unit is velocity, one can rewrite \\(Q=Av\\). The standard units of the variables are as follows:\n\n\\([Q] = [ \\frac{m^3}{s}]\\)\n\\([A] = [m^2]\\)\n\\([v] = [\\frac{m}{s}]\\)\n\n\n\nFig. 2.2 graphical description of flow $Q$\n\n\n\nGas pressure and gas laws: The relation between force \\(F\\) and pressure \\(p\\) is related by its contact cross section area A: \\(F=pA\\). The unit in Pascal \\([Pa]=[\\frac{N}{m^2}]\\)in the international system (SI) and it is \\([psi]=[\\frac{lb}{in^2}]\\) in english units. For many industrial aplications, one uses \\(bar\\).

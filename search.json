The controller calulates an input signal for the actuator. The output of the actuator starts manipulating the system. Since the controler does not receives any feedback on how the systems reacts on the command the results might be different from the desired behaviour. Examples for the application of open loop control are: A tennis player who hits the ball, if you turn on a light in you room or a DC motor without sensors.\n\n\n\nfig. 1.1: general structure of a open loop control\n\n\nTo improve the resulting behaviour and be able to correct possible differences between the commad value and the resulting value, one can implement sensors that observe the resulting behaviour of the systems or process. This sensors return the current behaviour to the controller and the controller can correct the input signal to the actuator. The following figure shows the general structure of a close loop control.\n\n\n\nfig. 1.2: general structure of a close loop control",

The input value can be done by different types of devices, digital or analogue inputs, for example. At the same time, the current room temperature is measured and compared to the reference. The difference between these two values are the input to the controller and the controller calculates the new opening value for a valve that opens the gas flow to the burner. The room gets warmer (or not) and a new temparature is measured. This new temparature value is then compared again to the reference value.\n\n\n\nfig. 1.3 Heating System\n\n\n\n\n\nfig. 1.4 representation of a heating System in blocks\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Processes\n\nProcesses that involve variables that can take a finite number of possible values or states.\nProcesses in which the output product is obtained through a series of operations.\n\nExample: Production of metalic pieces\nSteps:\n\nCut the piece\nTransport the piece\nDrilling A\nDrilling B\nTake the piece out\n\n\n\n\nfig. 1.5 example of the production of a metalic product",

    "text": "Biography\nHe is currently an full professor and researcher at ITAM. He completed his engineering studies with a specialization in Mechatronics at the University of Darmstadt. During his studies, he focused on the fundamentals of control theory, identification of systems and mechanics. After his studies in Darmstadt, he started working as a research assistant at the Laboratory of Machine Tools at the University of Aachen, RWTH Aachen.\nDuring the following six years at the RWTH, he worked as a scientific assistant and development engineer. During this time, he worked on his doctoral investigation. Besides the investigation, his responsibilities also included the coordination and management of investigation projects. His doctoral thesis (Adaptable parametrization of diagnostic systems by using digital drive signals for process monitoring) was defended on the 11th of March 2014 with a presentation about “Systems Engineering for Medical Devices”.\nHe continued his professional carrier at Roche Diagnostics as a Systems Engineer with a focus on simulation and computation. His primary task was the physical modeling and calculation of insulin delivery systems in order to define technical requirements as well as to verify changes of specifications. This task also included DoE in order to find the most relevant system parameters, the tolerance analysis, and statistical evaluations applying Six Sigma methods, e.g. to evaluate the risks of new consumable products for medical devices. He also applied the methods of Six Sigma to develop a quality gate for the selection of sterile consumable products for medical devices.\nHe lectures Control Engineering, Manufacturing of Components, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, as well as a Solid Mechanics, Design of Robotics Mechanisms, and Mechatronics Systems. He published several articles in international journals about diagnostics and monitoring of manufacturing processes.",

## Elements of a pneumatic circuit

The word ‘Pneumatics’ is derived from the Greek ‘neuma’ (air or breath). Originally, the term pneumatics designated the science of the movement and properties of air. This is the branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of compressed air, its generation, transmission and control.

The design of devices that used air energy dates back to the 18th century (with the pneumatic rifle). “Modern” devices: pneumatic rock drill, pneumatic brakes. “Modern” pneumatics was born in the 1950s, when techniques and forms of air energy control were introduced in industrial processes.

#### Why compressed air?

-   It is **abundant**. It is available in unlimited quantities.

-   It is **transportable**. It is easily transported through pipes.

-   It is **storable**. It is easily stored in tanks where pressure is maintained.

-   It is transmitted relatively **quickly**.

-   It is **clean**. In case of stagnation, it does not produce dirt.

*Advantages of pneumatic energy over hydraulic energy*

Air density is significantly smaller than that of oil (used in hydraulics). Therefore, the inertia effect is smaller. Air can be discharged into the atmosphere after a task. Pneumatic systems are more economical. Pneumatic systems are less toxic and cleaner. Pneumatic systems are lighter, easier to transport.

### Basic physical characteristics of gases

*Composition:* Types of gases that make up the air under consideration. Example: dry air at sea level is composed mainly of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (20.99%). *Shape and volume:* They have no defined shape or volume. They acquire the shape and volume of the tank that contains them. *Cost (Flow):* It is the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of the duct per unit of time.

The relative humidity is the amount of water vapor contained in volume of air. It depends on the air temperature and pressure. When the air is saturated, it means that the relative humidity is at 100%.

Consider the behavior of air with water under defined circumstances: temperature 20°C and a relative humidity of 50%. This means that it contains 8.7g of water which is the half of the maximum 17.4g.

When the compressor compresses the 4 $𝑚^3$. to form 1 $𝑚^3$, the $4×8.7=34.8 g$ of water cannot hold in it. The $𝑚^3$ can hold at most 17.4 g of water. The other $2×8.7=17.4g$ fall as drops.

![fig. 2.1 effect on air with relative humidity when compressed](figures/fig02-001.png){width="60%"}

*Conclusion:* When air is compressed, water $H_2O$ liquefies from gaseous state to liquid state. The water vapor in the air is also compressed and the result is similar to squeezing a sponge. The compressed air reaches a saturation of 100% relative humidity inside the tank. The separated water can be drained via a drainage system.

The flow is defined as the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of duct per unit of time. Generally the letter $Q$ is used. $Q = \frac{V}{t}=\frac{A s}{t}$ wit $s$ as displacement, $A$ as areaof the cross section and $t$ as time. Considering that $\frac{s}{t}$displacement per time unit is velocity, one can rewrite $Q=Av$. The standard units of the variables are as follows:

-   $[Q] = [ \frac{m^3}{s}]$

-   $[A] = [m^2]$

-   $[v] = [\frac{m}{s}]$

    ![Fig. 2.2 graphical description of flow \$Q\$](figures/fig02-002.png){width="352"}

*Gas pressure and gas laws:* The relation between force $F$ and pressure $p$ is related by its contact cross section area A: $F=pA$. The unit in Pascal $[Pa]=[\frac{N}{m^2}]$in the international system (SI) and it is $[psi]=[\frac{lb}{in^2}]$ in english units. For many industrial aplications, one uses $bar$. The relation between $bar$ and $Pa$ is $1 bar = 10^5 Pa =100kPa$. The pressure that air exerts “naturally” on the Earth's surface due to its weight is called atmospheric pressure (Atm): $1 atm = 1.01325 bar = 101,325 P$. Due to the weight of the air column above: it decreases at higher altitudes and increases at lower altitudes.

![fig. 2.3 pressure defined by force and cross section](figures/fig02-003.png){width="31%"}

*Gauge pressure (relative pressure)* indicated by the manometers (\$bar\$ or $ps$). It is the excess of air pressure with respect to atmospheric pressure. It is abbreviated $p_m$ ($p_g$ in English).

$p_{absolute}=p_m+1.01325 bar (1 atm)$

For simlification, one aproximates $1 atm \propto 1 bar$

Another unit of pressure measurement is the $torr$ or $mmHg$. It is equivalent to the pressure exerted by a one millimeter column of mercury. However, we won´t use this units in our course.

![](figures/fig02-004.png){width="60%"}

The gas behaviour can be explained by several laws, explained as follows with $V$ as volume and $T$ as temperature:

-   Pascal's law: $p_{in} = \frac{F_{in}}{A_{in}} = \frac{F_{out}}{A_{out}}=p_{out}$, with in as input and out as output

    Fluid pressure is transmitted equally in all directions. The force exerted by a piston is equal to the product of the effective area times the air pressure: Example of a Hydraulic Press:

![](figures/fig02-005.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

-   Boyle's law: $V_1 p_1 = V_2 p_2$ or $Vp=constant$ and $V \propto \frac{1}{p}$, with constant temperature $T$

-   Charles' law: $\frac{V}{T}=constant$, with constant pressure $p$

-   Gay-Lussac's law: $\frac{p}{T}=constant$, with constant volume $V$

## Elements of a pneumatic circuit

‘Pneumatics’ is derived from the Greek ‘neuma’ (air or breath). Originally, the term pneumatics designated the science of the movement and properties of air. Branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of compressed air, its generation, transmission and control.

The design of devices that used air energy dates back to the 18th century (with the pneumatic rifle). “Modern” devices: pneumatic rock drill, pneumatic brakes. “Modern” pneumatics was born in the 1950s, when techniques and forms of air energy control were introduced in industrial processes.

#### Why compressed air?

-   It is **abundant**. It is available in unlimited quantities.

-   It is **transportable**. It is easily transported through pipes.

-   It is **storable**. It is easily stored in tanks where pressure is maintained.

-   It is transmitted relatively **quickly**.

-   It is **clean**. In case of stagnation, it does not produce dirt.

*Advantages of pneumatic energy over hydraulic energy*

Air density is significantly smaller than that of oil (used in hydraulics). Therefore, the inertia effect is smaller. Air can be discharged into the atmosphere after a task. Pneumatic systems are more economical. Pneumatic systems are less toxic and cleaner. Pneumatic systems are lighter, easier to transport.

### Basic physical characteristics of gases

*Composition:* Types of gases that make up the air under consideration. Example: dry air at sea level is composed mainly of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (20.99%). *Shape and volume:* They have no defined shape or volume. They acquire the shape and volume of the tank that contains them. *Cost (Flow):* It is the quantity of fluid that circulates through a section of the duct per unit of time.

The relative humidity is the amount of water vapor contained in volume of air. It depends on the air temperature and pressure. When the air is saturated, it means that the relative humidity is at 100%.

Consider the behavior of air with water under defined circumstances: temperature 20°C and a relative humidity of 50%. This means that it contains 8.7g of water which is the half of the maximum 17.4g.

When the compressor compresses the 4 $𝑚^3$. to form 1 $𝑚^3$, the $4×8.7=34.8 g$ of water cannot hold in it. The $𝑚^3$ can hold at most 17.4 g of water. The other $2×8.7=17.4g$ fall as drops.

![fig. 2.1 effect on air with relative humidity when compressed](figures/fig02-001.png){width="60%"}

*Conclusion:* When air is compressed, water $H_2O$ liquefies from gaseous state to liquid state. The water vapor in the air is also compressed and the result is similar to squeezing a sponge. The compressed air reaches a saturation of 100% relative humidity inside the tank. The separated water can be drained via a drainage system.

*Gas pressure and gas laws:* The relation between force $F$ and pressure $p$ is related by its contact area A: $F=pA$. The gas behaviour can be explained by several laws, explained as follows with $V$ as volume and $T$ as temperature:

-   Pascal's law: $p_{in} = \frac{F_{in}}{A_{in}} = \frac{F_{out}}{A_{out}}=p_{out}$, with in as input and out as output,

-   Boyle's law: $V_1 p_1 = V_2 p_2$ or $Vp=constant$ and $V \propto \frac{1}{p}$, with constant temperature $T$

-   Charles' law: $\frac{V}{T}=constant$, with constant pressure $p$

-   Gay-Lussac's law: $\frac{p}{T}=constant$, with constant volume $V$
